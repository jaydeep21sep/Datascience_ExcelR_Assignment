True review after a week long use .....
","
I am writing a true review after around a week long use of these boat airdopes 141 ....CONS1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag,  voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .PROS-1. the sound quality and the bass are great .2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions .

great product under low price range
","
Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.

They pause music at the slightest of touch when you try to adjust them, but then other times they will ignore the hardest of touch when you are ACTUALLY trying to pause your music. And double tap for next song gesture doesn't work anymore idk why.2. Biggest issue, left ear bud stops charging constantly. My earbuds case is totally clean, but it keeps showing me ""10% battery remaining"" warning on my phone even if i leave this to charge for hours. Right one is just fine but left one just stops charging very often now and it doesn't get fixed for days, i have to hold the earbud down into the case for a long while and even then it can only MAYBE work.3. All the factory reset and all stuff to sort these issues don't work when one of the earbuds is totally dead and unable to charge.4. They are too soft and can easily fall out of ears if you make facial expressions for a minute or two. Only good for gym, bad for content viewing because you might laugh or smile.That's about it but this left earbud not working issue that i keep having is just really annoying. I don't know if this is just my issue with my specific unit though.

Using since 13months
","
I am using this for since 13 months, Initial momths it worked well, everything was fine but right now i feel the battery is getting weaker and it is always getting disconnect and the right earphone is not fitting into its pod, it keeps popping back but it is getting charged. I don't think it will work properly afte next 4 months. This product is not recommend for rough usage. This best part of it is its quality, but the inner quality doesn't last long and bot friendly for rough usage.These are some Pros and ConsPros :Good sound qualityBattery is goodAmazing product qualityCons :Gets disconnected for every 10 to 15 min and then gets reconnected after 20 to 25 sec.Doesn't work while running or in moderator wind.I am not a rough user, I use it everyday for 2 to 3 hrs only, so for me i felt it is right investment for 1100 rupees. Overall I am happy with its performance.My rating for this is 3.9/5.0

I recently bought NOICE earbuds, and they exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs and rich bass. They fit comfortably and stay in place during workouts. The battery life is impressive, and the noise-cancellation feature works well. Bluetooth connectivity is smooth and reliable. Overall, a fantastic pair of earbuds at a great price! Highly recommended!

Not worth as Primary Earphone
","
Sound quality is good but not up to the mark if compared to similar products in same price range and provides no noise cancellation, on the other hand at this price point you can see this feature.Bass Quality is not up to the mark, there are two modes, Normal and Beast mode but difference between them is almost null.One more point that at this price point if you add some more amount of money, you can get better connectivity earphone. You will see random disconnections and loss of audio while playback.Not Worth of price product and cause you pain in ears if used more than an hour due to it's low quality speaker. I have used Realme Buds in past at same price and they are better.I had stopped using these earphones for now.

So i bought this for my son in 2022 and it worked just fine but in early 2023 the right side started facing issues but we got it fixed at the boat service centre for free and were very satisfied but little did we know that the same issue would return again few months later we tried the same remedy but they said product warranty expired (we thought after service they'd given us a new product with new warranty etc) we were disappointed and of late they're customer service has been vary poor. So I've just given up on it now will shift to another tws later but otherwise everything is as marketed above. Cheers.

Sensors are way too sensitive!!
","
Good product, good sound quality, minimal noise. Connects right when you open the lid. Only problem I faced was the sensors being to sensitive 😅 turn to a side when u sleep or place a hand over the side of your ears , the sensor detects it all!!  A good thing being sensitive but kind of annoying when you have to play the music every time after it gets accidentally paused.Appreciable battery life👍

Boat airdopes with good quality sound at a reasonable price. 13mm size, fit is okay. Comfort level is ok, but not great. Charging back up is quite good. Connectivity is ok, sometimes goes off, but if you keep the airdopes back in the box, and put them back in your ears, they work fine. Generally, they are quite fine at a decent price.

Better than most EarBuds?
","
I recently had the opportunity to test and review the boAt Airdopes 141 Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Headphones, and I must say, they offer an impressive audio experience.Here's my detailed review:Design and Build Quality:The boAt Airdopes 141 feature a stylish and ergonomic design that fits comfortably in the ears. The earbuds are lightweight and come with different sizes of ear tips, ensuring a secure and personalized fit for all users. The Cyan Cider color variant adds a touch of vibrancy to the overall design. The IPX4 water resistance rating makes them suitable for workouts and light rain, providing peace of mind during outdoor activities.Sound Quality:The sound quality of the boAt Airdopes 141 is exceptional. The earbuds deliver immersive audio with clear vocals, well-defined mids, and punchy bass. Whether you're listening to music, watching movies, or gaming, the Airdopes 141 provide a rich and detailed sound experience. The low latency mode specifically designed for gaming ensures minimal audio lag, enhancing your gaming sessions.Battery Life and Charging:One of the standout features of the boAt Airdopes 141 is the impressive 45-hour playtime. With the charging case, you can enjoy extended hours of uninterrupted music playback. The earbuds themselves offer up to 5 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. The charging case supports USB Type-C fast charging, allowing for quick and convenient charging.Connectivity and Controls:The Airdopes 141 offer seamless Bluetooth connectivity, ensuring a stable and reliable connection with your device. The smooth touch controls on the earbuds are intuitive and responsive, allowing you to control music playback, answer calls, and activate voice assistants with ease. The Instant Wake N' Pair (IWP) technology ensures hassle-free pairing with your device as soon as you open the case.ENx Technology:The inclusion of ENx (Environmental Noise Cancellation) technology in the boAt Airdopes 141 enhances the overall audio experience. It helps reduce background noise, allowing you to enjoy your music or calls without distractions.Room for Improvement:While the boAt Airdopes 141 offer an overall excellent experience, there are a few areas that could be improved. The IPX4 water resistance rating, while suitable for light rain and workouts, may not be sufficient for heavy rain or water submersion. Additionally, some users may find the touch controls slightly sensitive, leading to accidental commands.Conclusion:In conclusion, the boAt Airdopes 141 Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Headphones with their impressive 45-hour playtime, low latency mode for gaming, ENx tech, and IPX4 water resistance are a great choice for those seeking a high-quality audio experience. The sleek design, comfortable fit, and smooth touch controls make them a compelling option in the market. With a few minor improvements, the boAt Airdopes 141 could easily become a top contender in the truly wireless earbuds segment.I hope you find this review helpful in making an informed decision. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!

I bought this product for my wife. Earlier I had bought Defy Gravity z for my use. I found Defy is much better product in bass and amplifying the sound than boat. Surprisingly the Defy is also manufactured by Boat only. The drawback in Defy is the fit to the ears is not perfect where as thr Boat fit is good.

Title: A Reliable Choice for Wireless EarbudsRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)I recently purchased a pair of true wireless earbuds, and after using them for a while, I can confidently say that they offer a satisfying listening experience with a few minor drawbacks.Pros:1. Sound Quality (★★★★☆): The sound quality of these earbuds is impressive, with clear highs and punchy bass. They provide an immersive audio experience, making music and podcasts enjoyable.2. Comfort (★★★★☆): The earbuds are comfortable to wear for extended periods. They come with multiple ear tip options, ensuring a snug fit and good passive noise isolation.3. Connectivity (★★★★☆): Pairing is straightforward, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable. The earbuds quickly connect to my devices, which is convenient.4. Battery Life (★★★☆☆): The battery life is decent, offering several hours of playback on a single charge. The charging case provides additional hours, making them suitable for daily use.Cons:1. Build Quality (★★★☆☆): While they feel lightweight and compact, the build quality leaves something to be desired. The plastic construction feels a bit flimsy, and I worry about their long-term durability.2. Touch Controls (★★★☆☆): The touch controls can be a bit finicky. Sometimes, accidental touches occur when adjusting the earbuds, which can be frustrating.3. Microphone (★★☆☆☆): The microphone quality is below par, particularly in noisy environments. Call quality suffers, and it can be challenging for others to hear you clearly.4. Limited Features (★★★☆☆): Compared to premium models, these earbuds lack some advanced features like active noise cancellation or advanced app integration.In summary, these true wireless earbuds are a reliable and budget-friendly choice for those seeking good sound quality and comfort. They are a suitable option for music enthusiasts and casual users. However, if you prioritize durability, advanced features, or crystal-clear call quality, you might want to consider higher-end alternatives.
